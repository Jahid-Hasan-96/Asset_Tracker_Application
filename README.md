## Corporate Asset Tracking System

The Corporate Asset Tracking System, constructed with Django, empowers companies to effectively oversee their corporate assets, including phones, tablets, laptops, and various devices allocated to employees. Through this application, companies can streamline the tracking of asset distribution, condition, and history, facilitating efficient asset management across diverse teams and departments.


## Features



**Multi-Company Support:** This application is tailored to accommodate multiple companies, granting each the ability to manage its own roster of employees and devices.

**Employee and Device Management:** Companies can effortlessly add employees and devices to their profiles. Employees can be linked to a specific company, while devices can be categorized based on their names and conditions.

**Device Delegation:** Companies possess the capability to assign devices to employees for defined durations. The application ensures device delegation integrity by verifying that devices aren't assigned if they're already in use by an employee.

**Device Log:** The system meticulously logs each device's checkout and return activities, documenting the employee, condition, and timestamps associated with each action.

**API Support:** Offering a RESTful API, the application facilitates seamless management of companies, employees, devices, and device logs. Developers can harness this API to seamlessly integrate asset tracking functionalities into diverse systems.
